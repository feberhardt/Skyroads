Installed libraries: pygame

To start the game, open the file game.py in the Command Prompt and click on 'Play now', in the opened window.

To get out of the way of the obstacles and avoid collision, use the arrow keys to move your car left or right. The game counter in the left upper corner gives you information how good you perform. To exit the game either close the window or press the escape-key.
